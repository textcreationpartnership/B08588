            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> there are very ſure of the Friendlineſs of the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> and the five other Nations above them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 24. The <hi>Mohawk Sachems,</hi> appeared in the Court-Houſe of <hi>Albany,</hi> with a Preſent of Beaver of about twenty pound value, who choſe their Speaker, he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king two or three Skins, the reſt ſitting ſilent, Roſe up and ſaid:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Brethren, we are now come as our Grandfathers uſed to do, to Renew our Unity, Friendſhip and Covenant made by us and you.</p>
            <p n="2">2 We deſire the Houſe, being the Covenant and Propoſition Houſe may be kept clean, that we may keep a clean, ſingle, and not a double heart.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We do now Renew the Former Covenant or Claim that hath been made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and you; <hi>(viz.) New-England, Virginia, Mary-land,</hi> and thoſe parts of <hi>America,</hi> that it may be kept bright on every ſide, and not ſuffered to ruſt, or be forgotten.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We are heartily ſorry to hear of the Bloodſhed by thoſe ill minded <hi>Indians</hi> to the <hi>Eaſtward;</hi> and we now Preſent this Guift as our <hi>Indian</hi> manner is, to wipe the Tears from the Eyes, and the Blood from off the Relations of thoſe who have loſt Friends by thoſe ill-minded men.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let the Tree of Love, Unity and Commerce grow and flouriſh, and let the Roots ſpread and branch forth through all our ſeveral Dominions, to ſtand faſt that none may move it; ſo that we may live under the ſhade of the Tree, ſo that the Sun of Diſcord and Quarrelling may not ſcorch and wound us.</p>
            <p n="6">6. We have heard there hath been ſeveral Embaſſyes the laſt year from you to <hi>Canady.</hi> that we could not be acquainted with, we do all publickly Above-board, and we deſire you do ſo alſo.</p>
            <p>We heard that the <hi>Eaſtern Indians</hi> came where ſome of our men were Hunting, deſirous to ſpeak with us, but we refuſed to have any diſcourſe with them, but warned them to be gone, ſo that they came not near our Forts, but went as they came.</p>
            <p n="7">7. We intend a Meeting of the Chief of our five Nations in a little time, at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madado,</hi> there further to conſider of publick Affairs, and deſire that you would ſend ſome perſons from you to hear what we ſhall Confer of, and alſo ſome of the <hi>River Indians</hi> if they ſee cauſe, the Meeting was chiefly intended to conſider what Anſwer to give the <hi>French,</hi> who had often ſent to have Speech with them.</p>
            <p>VVhen the <hi>Sachems</hi> had heard how Matters were circumſtanced, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and what News was come to hand, ſeemed to be glad, and much Rejoiced, &amp; wholly laid aſide their intended Meeting, promiſing neither to ſpeak with them, nor to allow the <hi>French</hi> to ſpeak to them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Albany</hi> ſay, the <hi>Mohawks</hi> ſhew themſelves very willing to go againſt the <hi>Eaſtern Indians,</hi> if Deſired.</p>
